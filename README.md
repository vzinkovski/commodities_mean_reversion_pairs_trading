**Commodities Mean Reversion Pairs Trading Strategy**

Most trading strategies can be classified as either momentum or mean reversion strategies. Commodities are often fungible, which means they can be used as substitutes for each other given the right economics. For such fungible commodities pairs this implies both a positive correlation, as well as cointegration. Cointegration simply means that the individual price series for the two commodities cannot deviate indefinitely and will revert to some mean value. This project will explore a mean reverting pairs trading strategy for a select universe of cointegrated agricultural commodities pairs. An inherent advantage of restricting our universe to commodities only is that these will be naturally free from survivorship bias. The continuous front month futures contract is used throughout.
